  <p>Who are we? We are where you go before you send that Friday afternoon
  text message that reads, So what's the move this weekend? Our mission is to
  relieve you of the hard work. You want to know where to go, where to drink,
  eat and/or be merry? We're the shortcut,
the connect. We're your plug. Come along everyone. </p>
<p> We are LIVE this summer.</p></section>
